# tradeONION
Fully dynamic script to trade ONION on various exchanges.

To use this script you need an account and API key:secret pair for exchange(s) you wish to use. You may run SETUP.sh to assist in editing KEY/SECRET files and creating Desktop launcher. This has only been tested on Debian so you may need to create launcher manually.
The file API.txt is the API documentation from all exchanges available in script for your convenience.
